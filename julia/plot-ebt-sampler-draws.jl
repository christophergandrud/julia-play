Create question set to practice for the Deutscher Einb√ºrgerungstest. 
The official question set can be found at: <http://oet.bamf.de/pls/oetut/f?p=514:1:329473569276328:::::>.
The question set has 310 questions, but who knows, maybe this could change. Adjust the total 
question set with `total_questions::Int`.
